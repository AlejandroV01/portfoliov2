        I&apos;m Alejandro, a full-stack developer passionate about web development. Currently pursuing a Bachelor&apos;s Degree in Computer Science,
        I am expanding my skills beyond Java by self-teaching JavaScript, Next.js, Express.js, Node.js, React.js, MongoDB, and more. In my free time,
        I work on personal projects, engage in programming events, and prioritize maintaining a healthy mental state through activities like walking
        my dog.
